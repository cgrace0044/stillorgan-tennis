- ## Design

### Imagery

The imagery used on the Stillorgan Tennis site is very important to the overall experience of the user. The pictures chosen evoke a feeling of happiness from exercising.

### Colours

The colour scheme of the website is predominently white and green with hints of gold. Green was chosen as it is a colour which is regularly associated with tennis as most clubs used to have grass courts. White and green together create a relaxing vibe. The gold accents add an element of luxury to the design.

### Fonts

The Roboto Slab and Roboto fonts are the main fonts used throughout the whole website. This font was imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I'm using Sans Serif as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
